Parametric Machines




- [x] Download a new dataset (bees and wasps)
- [x] Do preprocessing (resize and grayify) and make data usable for our models
- [x] Work with convolutional and dense network
- [x] Plot train loss function and accuracy
- [x] Change datatypes in some more general (ex: string -> abstractstring)
- [x] Make get_data more usable in general (changing the repository parameters)
- [x] Change accuracy to work with more than 2 labels
- [x] Tests for accuracy (and something else?)
- [x] Create some examples with parametric machines (https://github.com/LimenResearch/ParametricMachinesDemos.jl)
